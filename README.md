Q1: What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?

A1: my only observation is that I knew what I had to do logical wise, but struggeled when applying it. I've finally managed to figure out the logic behind flex and I applied it in this project, it feels so good to finally know how to stylise your website as you imagine it to be or at least make it similar to your thoughts as we need to learn more about css and how to apply it. In terms of programming, JS is still confusing me, I get the logic and I understand what I need to do, but when I reach the functions and the applying part of the job, I get confused and do a reaseach and check online and rewatch the lectures and it confuses me more because everyone does the same job in a different way, using different commands and methods.

Q2: How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

A2: It took me 12 hours to complete with styling and everything, I thought it would take about 3 hours.
